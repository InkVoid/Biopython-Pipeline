# Biopython-Pipeline
GeneScope is a Streamlit-based bioinformatics app that fetches sequences from NCBI or FASTA files and performs core analyses like GC/AT content, transcription/translation, ORF detection, codon usage, BLASTn, and protein structure lookup. Built with Biopython, it offers simple, reproducible workflows.
