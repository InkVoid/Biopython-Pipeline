# Biopython-Pipeline
GeneScope is a lightweight Streamlit-based bioinformatics tool that allows users to fetch DNA/RNA sequences from NCBI using accession IDs or FASTA uploads and perform core analyses in one place. It provides sequence statistics, GC/AT content, transcription/translation, codon usage, ORF detection, annotated CDS, BLASTn searches, and protein structure lookup with embedded 3D visualization. Designed with simplicity in mind, it uses only Biopython functions for computation and presents results with interactive visuals and tables. GeneScope is intended as an easy-to-use pipeline for students and researchers to replicate basic bioinformatics workflows on their local machines.
